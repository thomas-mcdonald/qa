  In order to participate in selecting quality answer to questions
  As a user of the site
  I want to be able to interact with the voting system

    Given there exists a question
    When I visit the question page
    And I click on the upvote question button
    Then I am told I have to log in

  @javascript
  Scenario: User can upvote
    Given I am logged in
    And there exists a question
    When I visit the question page
    And I click on the upvote question button
    Then I see an active upvote
    And I see an updated vote count
